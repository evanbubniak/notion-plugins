# notion-plugins

I use Notion to track my habits on a day-to-day basis as well as save resources and notes about my hobbies. For instance, I have a table that serve as hubs for the languages I'm learning and resources for studying them. I have another for habits, where I can log my exercise routines, amount of sleep, and time spent on hobbies each day.

I wrote a daily script here `start_day.js` for updating my habit table each day and being able to easily fill in data from previous days.
